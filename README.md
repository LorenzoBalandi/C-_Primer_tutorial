# C++_Primer_tutorial
C++ file used to test what learned in chapters 1-6 of **C++ Primer** book. This is not a full tutorial, it is just an utility file I used to make practice. I share it in case it can be useful to others.

To execute the code related to a specific topic only comment/uncomment the following lines:
```
#define IOSTREAM
#define STRING
#define VECTOR
#define ARRAYS
#define EXPRESSIONS
#define STATEMENTS
#define FUNCTIONS
```
To **compile** C++ code:
```
g++ -o cpp_book_1 cpp_book_1.cpp
```
To **run** compiled code:
```
./cpp_book_1
```
